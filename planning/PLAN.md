# FinAlly — AI Trading Workstation

## Project Specification

## 1. Vision

FinAlly (Finance Ally) is a visually stunning AI-powered trading workstation that streams live market data, lets users trade a simulated portfolio, and integrates an LLM chat assistant that can analyze positions and execute trades on the user's behalf. It looks and feels like a modern Bloomberg terminal with an AI copilot.

This is the capstone project for an agentic AI coding course. It is built entirely by Coding Agents demonstrating how orchestrated AI agents can produce a production-quality full-stack application. Agents interact through files in `planning/`.

## 2. User Experience

### First Launch

The user runs a single Docker command (or a provided start script). A browser opens to `http://localhost:8000`. No login, no signup. They immediately see:

- A watchlist of 10 default tickers with live-updating prices in a grid
- $10,000 in virtual cash
- A dark, data-rich trading terminal aesthetic
- An AI chat panel ready to assist

### What the User Can Do

- **Watch prices stream** — prices flash green (uptick) or red (downtick) with subtle CSS animations that fade
- **View sparkline mini-charts** — price action beside each ticker in the watchlist, accumulated on the frontend from the SSE stream since page load (sparklines fill in progressively)
- **Click a ticker** to see a larger detailed chart in the main chart area
- **Buy and sell shares** — market orders only, instant fill at current price, no fees, no confirmation dialog. Long-only: no short selling, no margin
- **Monitor their portfolio** — a heatmap (treemap) showing positions sized by weight and colored by P&L, plus a P&L chart tracking total portfolio value over time
- **View a positions table** — ticker, quantity, average cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **View trade history** — a log of every executed trade (manual and AI), newest first
- **Reset the portfolio** — one click restores $10,000 cash, clears positions, trades, snapshots, and chat history, and restores the default watchlist
- **Chat with the AI assistant** — ask about their portfolio, get analysis, and have the AI execute trades and manage the watchlist through natural language
- **Manage the watchlist** — add/remove tickers manually or via the AI chat

### Visual Design

- **Dark theme**: backgrounds around `#0d1117` or `#1a1a2e`, muted gray borders, no pure black
- **Price flash animations**: brief green/red background highlight on price change, fading over ~500ms via CSS transitions
- **Connection status indicator**: a small colored dot (green = connected, yellow = reconnecting, red = disconnected) visible in the header
- **Professional, data-dense layout**: inspired by Bloomberg/trading terminals — every pixel earns its place
- **Responsive but desktop-first**: optimized for wide screens, functional on tablet

### Color Scheme
- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a`
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7`
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` (submit buttons)

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Single Container, Single Port

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, built as a static export (`output: 'export'`), served by FastAPI as static files
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), managed as a `uv` project
- **Database**: SQLite, single file at `db/finally.db`, volume-mounted for persistence
- **Real-time data**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) — simpler than WebSockets, one-way server→client push, works everywhere
- **AI integration**: LiteLLM → OpenRouter → `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` (free tier), with structured outputs for trade execution
- **Market data**: Environment-variable driven — simulator by default, real data via Massive API if key provided

### Why These Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| SSE over WebSockets | One-way push is all we need; simpler, no bidirectional complexity, universal browser support |
| Static Next.js export | Single origin, no CORS issues, one port, one container, simple deployment |
| SQLite over Postgres | No auth = no multi-user = no need for a database server; self-contained, zero config |
| Single Docker container | Students run one command; no docker-compose for production, no service orchestration |
| uv for Python | Fast, modern Python project management; reproducible lockfile; what students should learn |
| Market orders only | Eliminates order book, limit order logic, partial fills — dramatically simpler portfolio math |

### Key Boundaries

- **`frontend/`** is a self-contained Next.js project. It knows nothing about Python. It talks to the backend via `/api/*` endpoints and `/api/stream/*` SSE endpoints. Internal structure is up to the Frontend Engineer agent.
- **`backend/`** is a self-contained uv project with its own `pyproject.toml`. It owns all server logic including database initialization, schema, seed data, API routes, SSE streaming, market data, and LLM integration. Internal structure is up to the Backend/Market Data agents.
- **`backend/db/`** contains schema SQL definitions and seed logic. The backend lazily initializes the database on first request — creating tables and seeding default data if the SQLite file doesn't exist or is empty.
- **`db/`** at the top level is the runtime volume mount point. The SQLite file (`db/finally.db`) is created here by the backend and persists across container restarts via Docker volume.
- **`planning/`** contains project-wide documentation, including this plan. All agents reference files here as the shared contract.
- **`test/`** contains Playwright E2E tests and supporting infrastructure (e.g., `docker-compose.test.yml`). Unit tests live within `frontend/` and `backend/` respectively, following each framework's conventions.
- **`scripts/`** contains start/stop scripts that wrap Docker commands.

---

## 5. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: OpenRouter API key for LLM chat functionality
OPENROUTER_API_KEY={KEY}

# Optional: Massive (Polygon.io) API key for real market data
# If not set, the built-in market simulator is used (recommended for most users)
MASSIVE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Set to "true" for deterministic mock LLM responses (testing)
LLM_MOCK=false
```

### Behavior

- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is set and non-empty → backend uses Massive REST API for market data
- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is absent or empty → backend uses the built-in market simulator
- If `LLM_MOCK=true` → backend returns deterministic mock LLM responses (for E2E tests)
- In Docker, environment variables are passed with `docker run --env-file .env` (the `.env` file is not mounted into the container). For local development the backend loads `.env` from the project root via `python-dotenv`.

---

## 6. Market Data

### Two Implementations, One Interface

Both the simulator and the Massive client implement the same abstract interface. The backend selects which to use based on the environment variable. All downstream code (SSE streaming, price cache, frontend) is agnostic to the source.

### Simulator (Default)

- Generates prices using geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with configurable drift and volatility per ticker
- Updates at ~500ms intervals
- Correlated moves across tickers (e.g., tech stocks move together)
- Occasional random "events" — sudden 2-5% moves on a ticker for drama
- Starts from realistic seed prices (e.g., AAPL ~$190, GOOGL ~$175, etc.)
- Runs as an in-process background task — no external dependencies

### Massive API (Optional)

- REST API polling (not WebSocket) — simpler, works on all tiers
- Polls for all tracked tickers (see below) on a configurable interval
- Free tier (5 calls/min): poll every 15 seconds
- Paid tiers: poll every 2-15 seconds depending on tier
- Parses REST response into the same format as the simulator

### Tracked Tickers

The set of tickers the market data source tracks is **watchlist ∪ tickers with an open position**. This guarantees that portfolio valuation, the heatmap, and the positions table never go stale.

- Removing a ticker from the watchlist removes it from the watchlist UI, but the data source keeps tracking it while a position exists. Tracking stops when the ticker is neither watched nor held (e.g. after the position is fully sold).
- Buying a ticker that isn't on the watchlist is allowed only if it already has a cached price (see Ticker Validation), and it is then tracked for as long as the position exists.

### Ticker Validation

- Tickers are normalized to uppercase and must match `^[A-Z]{1,5}$`. Anything else is rejected with `400`.
- **Simulator**: any valid symbol is accepted. Known tickers use their realistic seed price; unknown tickers get a random seed price between $50 and $500 and default GBM parameters. The simulator seeds the price into the cache immediately on add, so there is no window without a price.
- **Massive**: on add, the backend fetches the ticker's snapshot immediately. If Massive returns no data, the add is rejected with `404 {"error": "Unknown ticker: XYZ"}` and nothing is written to the watchlist.
- **Trades require a cached price.** A trade for a ticker with no price in the cache is rejected with `400 {"error": "No price available for XYZ"}`.

### Shared Price Cache

- A single background task (simulator or Massive poller) writes to an in-memory price cache
- The cache holds the latest price, previous price, and timestamp for each ticker
- SSE streams read from this cache and push updates to connected clients
- This architecture supports future multi-user scenarios without changes to the data layer

### SSE Streaming

- Endpoint: `GET /api/stream/prices`
- Long-lived SSE connection; client uses native `EventSource` API
- Server pushes price updates for all tracked tickers (watchlist ∪ open positions) at a regular cadence (~500ms)
- Each SSE event contains ticker, price, previous price, timestamp, and change direction
- Client handles reconnection automatically (EventSource has built-in retry)

---

## 7. Database

### SQLite with Lazy Initialization

The backend checks for the SQLite database on startup (or first request). If the file doesn't exist or tables are missing, it creates the schema and seeds default data. This means:

- No separate migration step
- No manual database setup
- Fresh Docker volumes start with a clean, seeded database automatically

### Schema

All tables include a `user_id` column defaulting to `"default"`. This is hardcoded for now (single-user) but enables future multi-user support without schema migration.

**users_profile** — User state (cash balance)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (default: `"default"`)
- `cash_balance` REAL (default: `10000.0`)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**watchlist** — Tickers the user is watching
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `added_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**positions** — Current holdings (one row per ticker per user). When a sell brings quantity to zero (treat `abs(quantity) < 1e-9` as zero to absorb float error), the row is **deleted**. Quantity is never negative (no short selling).
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `avg_cost` REAL
- `updated_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**trades** — Trade history (append-only log)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `side` TEXT (`"buy"` or `"sell"`)
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `price` REAL
- `executed_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**portfolio_snapshots** — Portfolio value over time (for P&L chart). Recorded every 30 seconds by a background task, and immediately after each trade execution. The background task runs whether or not any client is connected. Retention is capped at **10 days**: the same background task deletes snapshots older than 10 days.
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `total_value` REAL
- `recorded_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**chat_messages** — Conversation history with LLM
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `role` TEXT (`"user"` or `"assistant"`)
- `content` TEXT
- `actions` TEXT (JSON — the `actions` object from the `/api/chat` response, including per-action status and errors; null for user messages)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

### Default Seed Data

- One user profile: `id="default"`, `cash_balance=10000.0`
- Ten watchlist entries: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, V, NFLX

The **reset** endpoint (`POST /api/portfolio/reset`) restores exactly this state: it deletes all positions, trades, snapshots, chat messages, and watchlist rows for the user, sets cash back to `10000.0`, and re-seeds the default watchlist.

## 8. API Endpoints

### Market Data
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/stream/prices` | SSE stream of live price updates |

### Portfolio
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/portfolio` | Current positions, cash balance, total value, unrealized P&L |
| POST | `/api/portfolio/trade` | Execute a trade: `{ticker, quantity, side}` |
| GET | `/api/portfolio/history` | Portfolio value snapshots over the last 10 days (for P&L chart), oldest first |
| GET | `/api/portfolio/trades` | Trade history, newest first (optional `?limit=`, default 100) |
| POST | `/api/portfolio/reset` | Reset to the seed state (see Section 7). Returns the fresh portfolio |

### Watchlist
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/watchlist` | Current watchlist tickers with latest prices |
| POST | `/api/watchlist` | Add a ticker: `{ticker}` |
| DELETE | `/api/watchlist/{ticker}` | Remove a ticker (keeps being tracked for prices while a position exists; see Section 6) |

### Chat
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/chat` | Send a message `{message}`, receive complete JSON response (message + executed actions) |

### System
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check (for Docker/deployment) |

### Conventions

- **Errors**: all errors return a JSON body `{"error": "<human-readable message>"}` with an appropriate status: `400` for validation failures (bad ticker, quantity ≤ 0, insufficient cash, insufficient shares, no price available), and `404` for unknown resources.

### Trade Contract

`POST /api/portfolio/trade`

```json
{"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 2.5}
```

- `quantity` must be > 0. Fractional quantities are allowed (the UI accepts decimals).
- `side` is `"buy"` or `"sell"`. Buys require `quantity × price ≤ cash`. Sells require `quantity ≤ held quantity`. No short selling, no margin.
- Fills at the current cached price. Buys update `avg_cost` as a weighted average. Sells leave `avg_cost` unchanged, and the position row is deleted when quantity reaches zero.
- Every successful trade appends a `trades` row and records a portfolio snapshot.

Success response (`200`): the fill plus the updated portfolio, so the frontend needs only one request:

```json
{
  "trade": {"id": "…", "ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 2.5, "price": 191.23, "executed_at": "2026-09-25T14:03:11Z"},
  "portfolio": { /* same shape as GET /api/portfolio */ }
}
```

### Chat Response Contract

`POST /api/chat` returns:

```json
{
  "message": "Placing an order for 10 AAPL and adding PYPL to your watchlist.",
  "actions": {
    "trades": [
      {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10, "status": "executed", "price": 191.23},
      {"ticker": "TSLA", "side": "buy", "quantity": 500, "status": "failed", "error": "Insufficient cash"}
    ],
    "watchlist_changes": [
      {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add", "status": "executed"}
    ]
  }
}
```

The same `actions` object is stored in `chat_messages.actions`.

---

## 9. LLM Integration

All LLM calls use LiteLLM via OpenRouter to the free model `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free`. Only free (`:free`) models may be used; the project must not incur any LLM cost. Structured Outputs are used to interpret the results.

There is an OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the .env file in the project root. The backend `uv` project must include `litellm` and `pydantic`.

As of 2026-09-25, this model is served on OpenRouter by Nvidia at zero cost, and its endpoint supports `response_format` / structured outputs and `reasoning_effort`. Free models are rate-limited by OpenRouter (roughly 20 requests/minute, and a daily cap that depends on the account's credit history), which is ample for a single user. When a rate limit is hit, the chat call fails and the user is told to try again shortly.

### Calling the LLM

```python
from litellm import completion

MODEL = "openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free"

response = completion(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=messages,
    response_format=ChatResponse,  # Pydantic model matching the schema below
    reasoning_effort="low",
)
result = ChatResponse.model_validate_json(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### How It Works

When the user sends a chat message, the backend:

1. Loads the user's current portfolio context (cash, positions with P&L, watchlist with live prices, total portfolio value)
2. Loads the **last 5 messages** of conversation history from the `chat_messages` table
3. Constructs a prompt with a system message, portfolio context, conversation history, and the user's new message
4. Calls the LLM via LiteLLM → OpenRouter, requesting structured output (see Calling the LLM)
5. Parses the complete structured JSON response
6. Auto-executes any trades or watchlist changes specified in the response (see Auto-Execution)
7. Stores the message and executed actions in `chat_messages`
8. Returns the complete JSON response to the frontend (no token-by-token streaming — a loading indicator is shown while waiting)

### Structured Output Schema

The LLM is instructed to respond with JSON matching this schema:

```json
{
  "message": "Your conversational response to the user",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": [
    {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add"}
  ]
}
```

- `message` (required): The conversational text shown to the user
- `trades` (optional): Array of trades to auto-execute. Each trade goes through the same validation as manual trades (sufficient cash for buys, sufficient shares for sells, no short selling or margin)
- `watchlist_changes` (optional): Array of watchlist modifications

### Auto-Execution

Trades specified by the LLM execute automatically — no confirmation dialog. This is a deliberate design choice:
- It's a simulated environment with fake money, so the stakes are zero
- It creates an impressive, fluid demo experience
- It demonstrates agentic AI capabilities — the core theme of the course

Execution rules:
- Watchlist changes are applied first, then trades, each in the order the LLM listed them.
- Each action executes **independently**: if one fails validation (e.g. insufficient cash), the others still run.
- Every action's outcome (`executed` or `failed` plus `error`) is returned in the `actions` object of the chat response (see Section 8) and rendered inline by the frontend as a confirmation or an error.
- Because the LLM writes its `message` before execution happens, the system prompt instructs it to phrase trades as intentions ("Placing an order for…"), never as confirmed fills. The inline action results are the source of truth.
- The next turn's history includes the stored `actions`, so the LLM can see and acknowledge failures from the previous turn.

### System Prompt Guidance

The LLM should be prompted as "FinAlly, an AI trading assistant" with instructions to:
- Analyze portfolio composition, risk concentration, and P&L
- Suggest trades with reasoning
- Execute trades when the user asks or agrees
- Never short sell or use margin: only sell shares that are held, and only buy with available cash
- Phrase trades as intentions ("Placing an order for…"), since execution happens after the response is written
- Manage the watchlist proactively
- Be concise and data-driven in responses
- Always respond with valid structured JSON

### LLM Mock Mode

When `LLM_MOCK=true`, the backend returns deterministic mock responses instead of calling OpenRouter. This enables:
- Fast, free, reproducible E2E tests
- Development without an API key
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 10. Frontend Design

### Layout

The frontend is a single-page application with a dense, terminal-inspired layout. The specific component architecture and layout system is up to the Frontend Engineer, but the UI should include these elements:

- **Watchlist panel** — grid/table of watched tickers with: ticker symbol, current price (flashing green/red on change), daily change %, and a sparkline mini-chart (accumulated from SSE since page load)
- **Main chart area** — larger chart for the currently selected ticker, with at minimum price over time. Clicking a ticker in the watchlist selects it here. Like the sparklines, it shows only prices accumulated from SSE since page load (no seeded history), so it fills in progressively.
- **Portfolio heatmap** — treemap visualization where each rectangle is a position, sized by portfolio weight, colored by P&L (green = profit, red = loss)
- **P&L chart** — line chart showing total portfolio value over time, using data from `portfolio_snapshots`
- **Positions table** — tabular view of all positions: ticker, quantity, avg cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Trade history** — table of executed trades from `GET /api/portfolio/trades`: time, ticker, side, quantity, price. Refreshed after every trade and chat action
- **Trade bar** — simple input area: ticker field, quantity field, buy button, sell button. Market orders, instant fill.
- **AI chat panel** — docked/collapsible sidebar. Message input, scrolling conversation history, loading indicator while waiting for LLM response. Trade executions and watchlist changes shown inline as confirmations.
- **Header** — portfolio total value (updating live), connection status indicator, cash balance, and a **Reset** button that calls `POST /api/portfolio/reset`

### Technical Notes

- Use `EventSource` for SSE connection to `/api/stream/prices`
- **Charting**: use **Lightweight Charts** (canvas-based) for the main price chart, sparklines, and P&L chart. Lightweight Charts has no treemap, so implement the heatmap as a small custom squarified treemap using absolutely positioned divs (no extra charting dependency).
- **Live valuation is owned by the frontend**: `GET /api/portfolio` is a snapshot. The frontend recomputes position values, unrealized P&L, heatmap colors, and header total value from SSE prices × held quantities on every tick. It re-fetches `/api/portfolio` (and trade history) after manual trades, chat responses with actions, and reset.
- Price flash effect: on receiving a new price, briefly apply a CSS class with background color transition, then remove it
- All API calls go to the same origin (`/api/*`) — no CORS configuration needed
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom dark theme

---

## 11. Docker & Deployment

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```
Stage 1: Node 20 slim
  - Copy frontend/
  - npm install && npm run build (produces static export)

Stage 2: Python 3.12 slim
  - Install uv
  - Copy backend/
  - uv sync (install Python dependencies from lockfile)
  - Copy frontend build output into a static/ directory
  - Expose port 8000
  - CMD: uvicorn serving FastAPI app
```

FastAPI serves the static frontend files and all API routes on port 8000. All `/api` routers are registered **first**, and the static export is mounted last at `/` with `StaticFiles(directory="static", html=True)`, so API routes always take precedence. The app is a single page, so no client-side route fallback is needed.

### Docker Volume

The SQLite database persists via a named Docker volume:

```bash
docker run -v finally-data:/app/db -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env finally
```

The `db/` directory in the project root maps to `/app/db` in the container. The backend writes `finally.db` to this path.

### Start/Stop Scripts

**`scripts/start_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Builds the Docker image if not already built (or if `--build` flag passed)
- Runs the container with the volume mount, port mapping, and `--env-file .env`
- Prints the URL to access the app
- Optionally opens the browser

**`scripts/stop_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Stops and removes the running container
- Does NOT remove the volume (data persists)

**`scripts/start_windows.ps1`** / **`scripts/stop_windows.ps1`**: PowerShell equivalents for Windows.

All scripts should be idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

### Optional Cloud Deployment

The container is designed to deploy to AWS App Runner, Render, or any container platform. A Terraform configuration for App Runner may be provided in a `deploy/` directory as a stretch goal, but is not part of the core build.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (within `frontend/` and `backend/`)

**Backend (pytest)**:
- Market data: simulator generates valid prices, GBM math is correct, Massive API response parsing works, both implementations conform to the abstract interface
- Portfolio: trade execution logic, P&L calculations, edge cases (selling more than owned, buying with insufficient cash, selling at a loss, selling to exactly zero deletes the position, fractional quantities, quantity ≤ 0 rejected, trade with no cached price rejected), reset restores seed state, snapshot pruning after 10 days
- Tickers: validation regex, tracked set = watchlist ∪ positions, removing a watched-and-held ticker keeps it tracked
- LLM: structured output parsing handles all valid schemas, graceful handling of malformed responses, trade validation within chat flow, partial failure (one failed trade doesn't block the others), only the last 5 messages are sent as history
- API routes: correct status codes, response shapes, error handling

**Frontend (React Testing Library or similar)**:
- Component rendering with mock data
- Price flash animation triggers correctly on price changes
- Watchlist CRUD operations
- Portfolio display calculations
- Chat message rendering and loading state

### E2E Tests (in `test/`)

**Infrastructure**: A separate `docker-compose.test.yml` in `test/` that spins up the app container plus a Playwright container. This keeps browser dependencies out of the production image.

**Environment**: Tests run with `LLM_MOCK=true` by default for speed and determinism. Each test calls `POST /api/portfolio/reset` in its setup so tests are isolated despite sharing one database.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Fresh start: default watchlist appears, $10k balance shown, prices are streaming
- Add and remove a ticker from the watchlist
- Buy shares: cash decreases, position appears, portfolio updates
